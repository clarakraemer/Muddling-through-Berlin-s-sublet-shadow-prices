# Muddling-through-Berlin-s-sublet-shadow-prices

## 1. Step: Building a web scraper for the website WG-Gesucht 




## 2. Step (to follow): Comparing the apartment/room prices to a rent price indicator 

BAföG housing rate: Since the fall semester 2019/2020, students in Berlin with full BAföG entitlement receive 861€ per month. In addition to the 427€ for basic needs and 109€ for the statutory health insurance, students receive a flat rate of 325€ for housing costs (reference here). 
The information from room prices on WG-Gesucht could be compared against this amount, highlighting how high housing costs for students have become, partly because flatshare rooms posted on WG-Gesucht find ways to circumvent housing price regulations from the city, such as the recently passed rent price cap. 
In this scenario, we also wouldn’t need to find out/compute the net or gross rent price of entire flats, but simply use the full room price (including utilities) indicated on each posting.
